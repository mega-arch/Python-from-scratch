# Python from scratch
This repository contains a collection of 15 Python coding problems that focus on core programming concepts. These problems range from number manipulation to string processing, loops, pattern printing, and data structures. Each problem is designed to help you practice and understand Python programming fundamentals in an intuitive way.

Number Problems: These problems help you work with different numerical concepts, like checking whether a number is prime, calculating factorials, or summing digits.

String Problems: Challenges in this category involve working with strings, such as reversing a string, counting occurrences of characters, and finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

Loop Problems: This section emphasizes the use of loops in solving problems, including creating simple loops, printing patterns, and performing operations on arrays or lists.

Pattern Printing: Learn how to print various patterns, like triangles, squares, and pyramids, using loops. These problems are a great way to practice logical thinking and working with nested loops.

Index Problems: Focus on problems that deal with finding and manipulating indices in lists or arrays, such as finding the first non-repeating character or counting occurrences of an element.

Array-Based Problems: These problems dive into working with arrays or lists, including tasks like rotating an array, finding the maximum product of two elements, or implementing basic sorting algorithms.

Sorting Problems: Learn the implementation of sorting algorithms, like bubble sort or insertion sort, and practice sorting arrays and understanding the time complexity of different methods.

Searching Problems: Work on searching algorithms such as linear search or binary search, and solve problems that require efficient data retrieval from lists.
